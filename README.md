# Text-based Adventure Game using LLM
## Objective
To create a 2D text-based adventure Unity game where all non-player characters (NPCs) are powered by LLMs to dynamically drive NPC interactions and decision-making based on a short story with some background information.

## Description
Player works as a detective to unravel the mystery and find the truth of a series of disappearances in a small town.. 

Here, four unique NPCs, each with their own personalities and stories. Each NPC offers unique clues and tasks. Players' choices in tasks, or their selection of exploration sites, will guide them to different NPCs or locations, thereby uncovering varied narrative threads and achieving different scores.  
 
Each conversation, each clue uncovered through dialogue with NPCs, contributes to their overall score, reflecting the depth of their investigation and understanding. In creating this game, the goal was to redefine the narrative adventure genre, offering players not just a story to follow, but a mystery to live.
